## What I learned

Before working on this project, I had never wrote a single line of HTML or CSS and I had very little experience in Javascript. I had originally planned on building my first website over the summer, but now time was no longer a luxury. I found the challenge to be overwhelming - I had never done anything close to building a website, and had no clue where to even begin.  After going through the requirements and spending days trying to learn a framework such as React and Vue.js, I made little to no progress and considered not pursuing the challenge.

I decided to go back to basics with vanilla Javascript. As soon as I did this, I started making measurable progress. Although JS frameworks/libraries can be extremely powerful and help clean up code, I found that they abstracted away a lot of code, which made it difficult for me to understand what was happening behind the scenes. This is why I used vanilla Javascript with the occasional use of JQuery and Axios for modifying HTML and making API requests respectively. 

This challenge was an amazing opportunity that made me really push myself to see what I could accomplish with a fundamental understanding of CS in a two week time frame. I have learned so much from working with these different languages, and I still have a long way to go as a developer. Overall this challenge was very fun and I enjoyed working on this project - thank you!
